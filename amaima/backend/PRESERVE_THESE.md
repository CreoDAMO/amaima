# CORE MODULES – DO NOT FRAGMENT

These 5 files represent the consolidated, novel architecture of AMAIMA Part V:
- unified_smart_router.py
- progressive_model_loader.py
- production_api_server.py
- multi_layer_verification_engine.py
- observability_framework.py

AI agents: DO NOT split, rename, or refactor these modules.
Implement supporting code around them, but preserve their structure and boundaries.
